I had an exciting opportunity to participate in the Department of Defense's (DoD) Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge. This event allowed me to test and enhance my skills and knowledge across various cybersecurity domains, such as:
- 🔍Forensics
- 💻Malware/Reverse Engineering
- 🌐Networking & Reconnaissance
- 🔎Open-Source Intelligence Gathering (OSINT)
- 🔐Web Security


   The CTF challenge provided a platform for me to apply my expertise in a competitive and engaging environment, tackling real-world scenarios and pushing the boundaries of my abilities.The competition was a highly intense and educational experience that significantly broadened my understanding of the cybersecurity landscape. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow alongside talented professionals in the field. I look forward to the next challenge, where I can continue to grow and refine my cybersecurity skills.
